<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
My name is Lane. I'm 20 years old and I grew up in Springfield, Missouri, about 2.5 to 3 hours South of Columbia. I went to Kickapoo High School from which I graduated with a 3.8 non-weighted GPA. After graduating I found my way to Missouri State University. After doing two years there and switching between majors multiple times, I decided I was ready for a change and transferred to University of Missouri this year, and so far it's been a great experience and a much needed breath of fresh air. I'm now studying IT with a desire to do Cybesecurity or Sports Analytics.
